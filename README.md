## BDD

 Behavior: <br>*The program should:*       | Input:    | Output:     |
|:-------------|:------------- |:-------------|
| Cross check the sides to see if they form a triangle | 9, 4, 3  | It is not a triangle    |
| Check if the sides will form an equilateral triangle   | 5, 5, 5 | The triangle is equilateral |
| Check if the sides will form an isosceles triangle   | 5, 5, 4 | The triangle is isosceles |
| Check if the sides will form a scalene triangle   | 8, 5, 9 | The triangle is equilateral |
